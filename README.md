# <a id="01"></a>Learning_01_github

## GIT and Github

This repository consists of my learning the basics of GIT and Github essentials such as repositories, branches, commits, merge conflicts, collaboration, and pull requests. It also includes exercises I created to practice my learning. 

## How to get started
clone the repository https://github.com/ejb3ck3tt/Learning_01_github.git


## Basic commands
**git init** initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory.

**git clone** creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely.

**git add** stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer's codebase, but it's necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project's history.

**git commit** saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process.

**git status** shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.

**git branch** shows the branches being worked on locally.

**git merge** merges lines of development together. This command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct branches.

**git pull** updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart.

**git push** updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
