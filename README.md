## GIT and Github

This repository consists of my learning the basics of GIT and Github essentials such as repositories, branches, commits, merge conflicts, collaboration, and pull requests. It also includes exercises I created to practice my learning. 

## How to get started
clone the repository https://github.com/ejb3ck3tt/Learning_01_github.git


## Basic commands
**git init** initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory.

**git clone** creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely.

**git add** stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer's codebase, but it's necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project's history.

**git commit** saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process.

**git status** shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.

**git branch** shows the branches being worked on locally.

**git merge** merges lines of development together. This command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct branches.

**git pull** updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart.

**git push** updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.
